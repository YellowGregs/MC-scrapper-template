## Future Plans

### Short-Term Goals
- Create a homepage with sections like "Popular Releases", "Latest Releases.", and, etc.
- Add a comments feature.
  - *Will scraped from ManhwaClan Comment :).*
- Improve the website design.
  - I do like how it's kinda simple & basic, but needs to be improve.
- Improve the thumbnail quality to HD in details tab.
  - *Thumbnail in the detail tab has a bad quality thumbnail* 
- Include additional details, like descriptions in the details tab.
- Add navigation arrows for scrolling.
  - *Like Arrow going to the top of the page or bottom.*

### Long-Term Goals
- Implement Machine Translation (MTL), inspired by SnowMTL.
- Add raw chapter support.
  - *if I can.*
- Integrate free anime streaming using the Consumet API or through scraping
  - *To watch and read anime or manhwa.*
    - *Also this is suppose to be a manhwa/manhua/manga website, to read only for free, but I just want to add it for fun :)*.
- Add & Improve the scraping capabilities to include more manga content.
  - *Since the API I created mostly scraps manhwa, and manhua and a few for manga content.*

Will add more future plans later.
